        <h2>Applications of Radiology</h2>
        <p>Radiology is indispensable in modern medicine, with applications that extend beyond diagnosis to treatment
            and monitoring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diagnosing fractures, musculoskeletal disorders, and spinal conditions.</li>
            <li>Detecting and staging cancers, such as breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.</li>
            <li>Assessing cardiovascular conditions, including heart diseases and vascular abnormalities.</li>
            <li>Guiding minimally invasive procedures like biopsies, drain placements, and angioplasties.</li>
            <li>Monitoring the effectiveness of treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Imaging Modalities</h2>
        <p>Radiology encompasses several imaging modalities, each tailored for specific diagnostic and therapeutic
            purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>X-Ray:</strong> A quick and non-invasive way to view bones and certain internal organs. Often
                used for fracture detection and chest examinations.
            </li>
            <li><strong>CT Scan:</strong> Combines X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional
                images. Useful in detecting tumors, internal bleeding, and complex fractures.
            </li>
            <li><strong>MRI:</strong> Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of soft tissues
                such as the brain, muscles, and ligaments.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> Employs sound waves to visualize organs, tissues, and blood flow. Commonly
                used in obstetrics and for examining the heart and abdominal organs.
            </li>
        </ul>
